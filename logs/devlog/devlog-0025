## Layer 25: Refactor config, versioning, and rendering to use LAYER

### Conversation

**Todd:**  
start layer 25

**ai-agent:**  
To begin, please upload your current `chat-boot.md` file. This file contains the project’s rules, workflow, and versioning information, which I need to operate correctly.

---

**Todd:**  
here's the boot file

---

**ai-agent:**  
`chat-boot.md` has been loaded and parsed.  
- Current layer is **0024** (`move chat`)  
- The next layer will be **0025**  
- All layer operations, file expectations, logging, and Git integration rules are understood and will be followed strictly from this point.

Please confirm the **type** and **intent** for Layer 25, or provide the feature/fix/refactor you want to start.  
If you’re not sure, just describe what you want Layer 25 to accomplish and I’ll formalize the layer create step.

---

**Todd:**  
load the config file and get LAYER to from config.json which needs to be added.  I've attached the current config.json file. Load it into memory using the relative path to the app directory which is a level up from the src directory.

---

**ai-agent:**  
The `config.json` file has been loaded from the `app` directory. Here is its current content:

**Note:**  
- The `LAYER` key is currently **not present** in `config.json` and must be added.
- The value to set for `LAYER` should be the current layer number for this commit (**0025**).

**Next Steps:**  
- I will add `"LAYER": 25` to the `config.json` (using integer 25 for consistency).
- When Layer 25 is committed, the updated `config.json` will be included.

**Ready to proceed with `create layer` for Layer 25?**  
If yes, specify your intent/type for Layer 25, or just say “continue” to let me proceed with formalizing the layer creation.

---

**Todd:**  
yes

---

**ai-agent:**  
**Layer 25 creation initiated.**  
- **Type:** refactor (as we are updating config to reflect layer tracking, a structural change, not a feature or fix)  
- **Intent:** Add a `"LAYER"` key to `app/config.json` and update it to reflect the current layer with each new commit, per workflow. This will ensure all generated code and commits include accurate versioning information.

**Next step:**  
Generate the updated `config.json` with `"LAYER": 25` added.  
Would you like to review the diff, or proceed directly to the test step with the full code block for the updated file?

---

**Todd:**  
add the config loader

---

**ai-agent:**  
To clarify:  
You want to **add a config loader utility** in the project that will (1) load `config.json` from `app/config.json`, (2) make its content available as a Python object, and (3) can be used by other modules in `src/` for consistent config access.

Please confirm:
- The preferred file name (e.g., `config_loader.py` in `app/src/`)
- Should it provide just a simple `load_config()` function, or a class-based interface?
- Should the loader always read fresh from disk, or is it okay to cache the config after the first load (singleton style)?

Let me know your preferences or just reply “default” to proceed with a simple, reusable function called `load_config()` in `src/config_loader.py` that loads and returns the config as a Python dict, always reading fresh from disk.

---

**Todd:**  
the load path must be relative to the project directory

---

**ai-agent:**  
Understood. The config loader will:
- Use a **project-root-relative path** to locate `app/config.json`, regardless of the caller’s working directory.
- Provide a single function `load_config()` in `src/config_loader.py` that always loads the current config from disk as a Python `dict`.
- Be directly importable and usable by any module in `src/`.

**Ready to generate the full code for `src/config_loader.py`?**  
If you’d like anything else (e.g., error handling or logging), let me know now. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with a straightforward implementation.

---

**Todd:**  
test

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is the complete implementation for `src/config_loader.py` that loads `app/config.json` **relative to the project root** (not the script's current working directory):

This ensures `config.json` is always loaded relative to the **project root**, regardless of how or where the script is run. Let me know if you want a test or additional error handling.

---

**Todd:**  
give me config.json

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is the updated `app/config.json` file with the `"LAYER"` key added for Layer 25:

This version is ready to be committed as part of Layer 25.  
Let me know when you want to proceed to the complete/commit step, or if there are any other changes to make first.

---

**Todd:**  
I'll put the load_config function in utils.py

---

**ai-agent:**  
Confirmed.  
You will add the `load_config` function to `app/src/utils.py` instead of creating a separate `config_loader.py`.

Here’s the revised function, ready for direct insertion into `utils.py`:

Let me know if you want to preview the updated `utils.py` file with this code inserted, or if you’d like to continue to the completion/commit step.

---

**Todd:**  
here is the utils file, update get_version() to get_layer() to be called from game.py (also attached) if that's the right place to put it.

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is the plan, based on your latest instructions and files:

1. **In `utils.py`:**
   - Add the new `load_config()` function (as above).
   - Change any `get_version()` function to `get_layer()`, and update it to read the current `"LAYER"` from `config.json` using `load_config()`.

2. **In `game.py`:**
   - Update import(s) and add a call to `get_layer()` at the appropriate location (for example, storing it as a property or printing at game start).  
   - If you’re not sure where, a good default is to show the layer/version info on game start (title banner or similar).

I will now display the revised `utils.py` and the required changes to `game.py`.

---

**Todd:**  
test

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is the **fully updated** `utils.py` file (with `load_config()` and `get_layer()`), and an example revision for `game.py` that prints the layer at game startup.

If you want me to **directly edit and show your actual `game.py` file with this change**, let me know and I will output the complete revised file.  
Otherwise, these are the changes you requested for Layer 25. Ready for completion/commit?

---

**Todd:**  
be sure to replace version with layer where ever  it's used

---

**ai-agent:**  
Understood.  
I will update **all uses of “version”** in your `game.py` file to instead use **“layer”**, including variables, print messages, and any calls (such as `get_version()` → `get_layer()`). This guarantees all references are aligned with the new config key and workflow.

Here’s how the update will work:
- All `get_version()` calls or imports → `get_layer()`
- All variables named `version` → `layer`
- Any displayed or printed text saying “version” → “layer”
- The config loader now only uses and exposes the layer.

Let me know if you want to see the **full code of your actual `game.py` with all the correct substitutions applied**!

---

**Todd:**  
give me the full version of all the affected files so I can play test them

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here are the **fully updated versions** of both `utils.py` and `game.py` with all "version" references replaced by "layer", the loader added, and everything ready for playtesting.

Let me know if you need the same treatment for any other files, or want additional playtesting logic or features added.

---

**Todd:**  
the entire files, not just examples

---

**ai-agent:**  
Thank you for clarifying. Here are the **entire updated files**, with all “version” references replaced by “layer,” and the configuration loader included as specified.

Let me know if you need the same for any other files!

---

**Todd:**  
here is all of game.py

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is your **entire, updated `game.py`** with all changes to use "layer" instead of "version," and to utilize the new config loading workflow:

You can now playtest:  
- The current layer is printed at game start (auto from `config.json`).
- No "version" code or messages remain.
- All config loading is unified via `utils.load_config()`.

If you want any more tweaks or need a different file, just say the word!

---

**Todd:**  
hmm it's not referenced in game.py the place the change needs to be is in render.py:

---

**ai-agent:**  
Thank you for sharing the full `renderer.py`.  
Here’s what needs to change:

- Replace all uses of `game.version` with `game.layer`.
- This assumes `Game.__init__` sets `self.layer = get_layer()` as already done in the previous update.
- The overlay line will show the layer number, not the version string.

If there are any other affected files, let me know! This update, combined with the previous changes to `game.py` and `utils.py`, will now consistently show the current layer throughout the game.

---

**Todd:**  
regenerate game.py to fit with render.py

---

**ai-agent:**  
Here is your **regenerated `game.py`** designed to work seamlessly with the updated `renderer.py`.  
Key points:
- No “version” references remain; all use “layer”.
- `self.layer` is set in the `Game` class (`get_layer()` from `utils`).
- The renderer displays the current layer via `game.layer` as shown in your overlay.
- All config is loaded using `load_config()`.

You can now playtest with full layer tracking and a unified, consistent interface!

**Todd:**  
commit

**ai-agent:**  
### Layer 25 Complete: **Refactor config, versioning, and rendering to use LAYER**

#### **Files updated:**
- `app/config.json` (added `"LAYER": 25`)
- `app/src/utils.py` (removed all version logic, added config loader, added `get_layer`)
- `app/src/game.py` (uses `layer` not version, config loader, exposes `game.layer`)
- `app/src/renderer.py` (shows `Layer: {game.layer}` in overlay, never uses version)

Ready for you to merge and push.  
Let me know when you want to start Layer 26, or if you want any additional docs or tests!
