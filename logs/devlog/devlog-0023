## Implementation Notes

- All entity logic (Player, Adversary) is in `entities.py` with encapsulated trail/exploration state.
- All rendering logic and colorization is in `renderer.py`.
- All non-gameplay helpers and constants in `utils.py`.
- `game.py` is the main entry, orchestrating the full game and all interactions.
- All features from previous layers are preserved and tested.
