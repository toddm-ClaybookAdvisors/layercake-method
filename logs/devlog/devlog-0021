## Transcript

Todd: Visual, Sterling would like the player to look more like a stick figure

ai-agent:  
Instruction:  
Update the player’s appearance to a green stick figure (`†`), using the COLOR_GREEN constant.  
All other features remain unchanged.

Todd: before we finish this layer, one more thing. Please add the x,y coordinates to the top info bar

ai-agent:  
Acknowledged. The top info bar will now display the player’s coordinates as `Pos: (x, y)`, in addition to the version, tick, and FPS.

Todd: code preview

ai-agent:  
(Provides code preview for rendering `†` as the player and adding position to the status bar.)

Todd: commit layer

ai-agent:  
Layer committed as described.

## Implementation Notes

- Replaced green `@` with green `†` for the player.
- Added player position to the status bar: `Pos: (x, y)`.
- All logic for trail, fog, and UI preserved.
