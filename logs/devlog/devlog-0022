## Prompt 0022

**Original Prompt:**
let's add the adversary.  
icon: a bold red X  
behavior: moves randomly until it finds a wall then it follows the wall. If it encounters the players green trail it follows it until it encounters the player. the adversary has a red trail. if it touches the player the player loses. the adversary can see two tiles around it.

## Transcript

Todd: let's add the adversary.  
icon: a bold red X  
behavior: moves randomly until it finds a wall then it follows the wall. If it encounters the players green trail it follows it until it encounters the player. the adversary has a red trail. if it touches the player the player loses. the adversary can see two tiles around it.

ai-agent: [Restates and plans features]

Todd: preview

ai-agent: [Shows code preview]

Todd: see full updated game.py so we can test it

ai-agent: [Shows full code]

Todd: the adversary stopped moving. It is allowed to backtrack to get unstuck if that was the issue

ai-agent: [Describes fix, offers new code]

Todd: the entire game.py using the optional safety

ai-agent: [Shows corrected game.py]

Todd: the adversary's behavior is still weird. It is not exploring. As a clarification, when it finds your trail you get a message. The adversary is not visible under the fog of war.

ai-agent: [Plans improvements: true exploration, player notification, fog hiding]

Todd: yes, we also need the "lock on" functionality

ai-agent: [Acknowledges, confirms]

Todd: yes, show me the full code

ai-agent: [Shows full improved code]

Todd: the "lock on" behavior stopped working

ai-agent: [Explains why, suggests BFS from adversary to player along trail tiles]

Todd: yes

ai-agent: [Shows full code with robust lock-on]

Todd: the adversary still doesn't go towards the player when it finds the player's path. The adversary also needs to go through a wall gap and follow the hallway so it does't just bounce around

ai-agent: [Explains need for BFS to player and explicit hallway-following]

Todd: yes

ai-agent: [Final code: BFS lock-on to player and true gap/hallway following]

Todd: commit layer

ai-agent: [Shows artifacts and commit command]

## Implementation Notes

- All features were tested and refined in direct response to the full conversation above.
- See the transcript for precise rationale and code evolution.
