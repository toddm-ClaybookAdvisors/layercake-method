Todd: restructure my chat-boot.md file remove any mention of files that are mention as ignored now

ai-agent: I have loaded and parsed your current `chat-boot.md` file. To proceed, I need to know **which files are now marked as ignored** in your `.gitignore` or similar ignore configuration. If you can provide that list (or the updated `.gitignore` itself), I will:
- Remove any mention of those ignored files from `chat-boot.md`
- Restructure the document for clarity and alignment with your current repository setup

Please upload or paste your `.gitignore` or list the ignored files. Once I have that, I will generate a revised `chat-boot.md` with all references to those files removed.

Todd: not from my .gitignore, from the text of the boot file.   give me a preview of the files that are being removed from the boot context 

ai-agent: Thank you for clarifying. Based **on the text of your current `chat-boot.md`**, the following file(s) are mentioned as **obsolete or ignored** and should be removed from the boot context:

- `CHAT_LOG.md`  
- All other files (e.g., `PROMPTS.md`, `devlog/devlog-XXXX.md`, etc.) are referenced as active.

If you intended for any other file(s) to be considered ignored or obsolete, please specify. Otherwise, I will proceed to restructure `chat-boot.md` to remove all mention of `CHAT_LOG.md` and its prior role.

Would you like me to proceed?

Todd: add chat-transition

ai-agent: Understood. You want to **remove all mention of both `CHAT_LOG.md` (already marked obsolete) and `chat-transition/`** from the boot file context, treating them as ignored or no longer in scope.

Would you like the output as a complete file, or only the changed sections?

Todd: before we output the complete file, take a refactor pass to consolidate all explicit rules and add a rule that under no circumstances is the LLM to do any refactoring unless in a refactor layer.  A refactor is any code changes that aren't necessary to complete the work stipulated in the layer prompt.

ai-agent: Great. Here’s the **refactor pass plan** before outputting the revised file:
(assistant outlines consolidation plan and draft preview of "Rules & Policies")

Todd: review

ai-agent: Here’s the **consolidated “Rules & Policies” section** for review, incorporating your new refactor rule and reorganizing all existing explicit policies for clarity.

Do you want any changes or additions to this draft section before I proceed to the full file rewrite?

Todd: show me a draft of the full rewrite

ai-agent: Certainly! Below is a **draft of the full rewritten `chat-boot.md`**, with:
(assistant provides a complete draft, as requested)

Todd: actually remove any mention of the excluded files from the chat-boot.md

add that if any workflow is skipped to remind the user.

add the current workflow state name to the top of all responses except code blocks

ai-agent: **Acknowledged. Current workflow state: _refactor_ (drafting and review phase).**
(assistant confirms changes and shows a new draft reflecting those rules)

Todd: when a new state has been initiated, remind the user of its purpose and output

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (drafting and review phase)_**
(assistant explains and proposes a rule for state transition reminders, seeks confirmation)

Todd: give me the final draft

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (finalizing boot file update)_**
(assistant outputs a full, clean draft with all confirmed rules)

Todd: make sure to always include a descriptive to block comment about the file's purpose.  Include the layer number and LLM model used to generate it.

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (final review and compliance enhancement)_**
(assistant incorporates file header enforcement and updates the draft)

Todd: what model are you?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (final Q&A)_**
I am **GPT-4o** (also known as "gpt-4o" or "Omni"), released by OpenAI in June 2024...

Todd: but you're showing as 4.1

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (clarification)_**
(assistant explains the GPT-4o / 4.1 naming ambiguity and advises using GPT-4o (2024-06) in headers)

Todd: so the date determines the name of the model?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (clarifying model naming policy)_**
(assistant explains that date does not determine the model name, but is used for traceability)

Todd: so there's no way to show I'm using 4.1 when I'm generating code, which it excels at over base 4o

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (model/version transparency)_**
(assistant explains that "4.1" is an informal UI label for GPT-4o, and recommends using GPT-4o (2024-06) with an optional comment if needed)

Todd: can you tell the difference? for instance which release are you right now?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (LLM model/version introspection)_**
(assistant confirms model class is known, but not the minor version or deployment hash)

Todd: I just changed your model in the drop down, what would I refer to you as?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (model identification)_**
(assistant provides a table of model names and official references for all dropdown options)

Todd: why is "4.1" better at writing code?  the difference is palpable, even if it is slower

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (model comparison/explanation)_**
(assistant explains improvements and tuning in GPT-4o/"4.1" over prior GPT-4 models)

Todd: let's get back to my chat-boot.md

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (returning to boot file update)_**
(assistant confirms readiness and options for commit or further tuning)

Todd: what are the rules around the workflows as I have stated them

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (workflow rule clarification)_**
(assistant summarizes all explicit workflow rules and policies as currently defined)

Todd: add a step called merge this is used after a git merge to main is made at the end of each session, ask if a merge to main is going to be done, if it is, update the README.md (prompt for an upload if necessary).

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (adding merge workflow step)_**
(assistant proposes updated Layer Lifecycle with the new `merge` step and offers to output full draft)

Todd: I don't need instructions on the merge / pull request

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (finalizing merge step policy)_**
(assistant updates the merge step and confirms the policy)

Todd: give me the full draft

ai-agent: (assistant outputs full, policy-compliant chat-boot.md draft with all enhancements)

Todd: are there any improvements you would make?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (advising on possible improvements)_**
(assistant offers optional improvements for clarity, enforcement, and future-proofing)

Todd: I like everything except for #6...
incorporate the other changes, then let's tune this process

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (incorporating improvements & prepping for process tuning)_**
(assistant integrates all selected improvements and proposes language for manual edit detection)

Todd: let's talk about the manual update flow

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (manual update workflow discussion)_**
(assistant outlines the manual update flow, lists questions for process tuning)

Todd: notification and commenting to show the manual edit points.   Show and ask for verification as they may not be manual but some patching, etc

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (manual update policy tuning)_**
(assistant formalizes the manual edit detection/review policy and drafts integration language)

Todd: yes, this works

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (incorporating finalized manual edit policy)_**
(assistant confirms and prepares for full integration, requests final confirmation)

Todd: confirmed

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (final full output)_**
(assistant outputs the complete, finalized chat-boot.md with all enhancements)

Todd: 8. ** merge ** add that the git log --oneline should be provided so that the LAYER_INDEX.md can be updated with the correct commit hashes

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (merge step enhancement)_**
(assistant updates the merge step and asks if a full draft is desired)

Todd: give me the final

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (final output, merge step with git log requirement)_**
(assistant outputs the final, fully compliant chat-boot.md)

Todd: can you retroactively produce layer artifacts for this session?

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _refactor (retroactive artifact generation)_**
(assistant explains what will be produced, requests layer number and commit hash)

Todd: layer number 0027

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _retroactive artifact generation (layer 0027)_**
(assistant produces PROMPTS.md, devlog, and LAYER_INDEX.md entries for 0027, requests confirmation or devlog export)

Todd: follow the policy for devlog generation to the letter

ai-agent: **Current workflow state: _retroactive artifact generation (devlog compliance for 0027)_**
(assistant outputs a full, compliant, speaker-labeled transcript, without code or file outputs, per project policy)

Todd: when I say to the letter, I mean it, put the devlog in a markdown code window

ai-agent: (see above)

Todd: you aren't putting it in a markdown code block that can be copied.   You have put an empty markdown block before and after the text though 

ai-agent: (see above)
