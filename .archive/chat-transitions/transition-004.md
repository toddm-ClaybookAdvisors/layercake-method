## Transition Layer 24

**Purpose:**  
Transition layer to document the migration to a modular codebase and updated project workflow. No features or code changes are included in this layer.

---

### Summary of This Transition

- **Modular refactor completed in Layer 23:**
  - All entity logic moved to `entities.py`
  - Rendering logic moved to `renderer.py`
  - Utilities and shared constants moved to `utils.py`
  - `game.py` now orchestrates all major components
- **Project rules clarified and formalized** (see README.md and rules section below)
- **Python installation and environment setup instructions moved to [PYTHON_SETUP.md](../PYTHON_SETUP.md)**
- **Directory structure and all documentation updated for clarity and traceability**
- **Prompt index (`PROMPT_INDEX.md`) will be updated only after merge to main, not during feature or transition work**

---

### New and Reinforced Project Rules

- Every new feature, fix, or refactor is developed as a “layer,” beginning with a prompt and ending with `commit layer`
- `test`: Generate and display full, ready-to-run code for all affected files in a single markdown block
- `preview`: Show updated code or artifact preview after any change during the test cycle
- `complete`: Lock in the current tested code as the layer output, generate all logs/artifacts, and prepare the commit
- Every devlog must include the full, verbatim transcript of the conversation for that layer
- All documentation and code previews must be shown as a single, contiguous markdown block—never split across multiple chat messages
- Prompt index is only updated after merge to main (to avoid hash/order conflicts)
- All commit messages must end with the layer number in parentheses, e.g., `(0024)`
- All code and documentation must be LLM-generated and traceable to a prompt and commit
- Emoji are never used in code, documentation, or logs
