# PROJECT BOOTSTRAP — LLM-Driven Game Development

## Purpose

This is not a game development project — it is a **demonstration of how to use an LLM as a complete software development assistant**. The final output happens to be a terminal-based 2D adventure game.  
The true purpose is to showcase:

- Prompt-by-prompt development  
- A workflow where the human writes **no code**  
- The LLM performs all architectural, functional, and implementation tasks  
- Transparent, traceable iteration using Git  
- Best practices for writing and evolving effective prompts  

The human acts as **strategic lead, prompt author, reviewer, and tester**.  
The AI acts as **coder, collaborator, and documentarian**.

## Layer Types

All work is organized into numbered **layers**, each with one of the following types:

- `feature` — New capabilities or game mechanics  
- `refactor` — Code or architecture restructuring without behavioral change  
- `fix` — Resolves regressions or bugs  
- `move chat` — Starts a new thread, updates docs, carries state forward, **but does not increment the Layer number**

---

## Layer Lifecycle

Every layer follows the same structured lifecycle:

1. **`create layer`**  
   Begin a new feature, fix, refactor, or chat move. Specify type and intent.

2. **Prompt**  
   Describe what should happen.  
   **Original prompt is stored only in the devlog**, not `PROMPTS.md`.

3. **`test`**  
   Generate all affected code in a single, complete markdown block.

4. **Iterate**  
   Discuss, preview, and revise implementation.  
   **Full back-and-forth is logged to `devlog/devlog-XXXX.md`**.

5. **`complete`**  
   Confirm the implementation is finalized.

6. **`commit`**  
   Generate artifacts:  
   - `PROMPTS.md` → interpreted instruction only  
   - `devlog/devlog-XXXX.md` → *authoritative conversation log*  
   - Git commit (must end with layer number, e.g., `(0024)`)  
   - `chat-boot.md` if `move chat`  

7. After the layer is commited to git remind me not to push yet, then prompt for the new "git log --onefile" then use it generate the `PROMPT_INDEX.md` and create the git ammend command that doesn't update the commit message.

## File Expectations

- No user-authored code is committed — all code must be generated by the LLM  
- If a file is to be modified and is **not already loaded in context**, the assistant will prompt the user to upload it  
- All code previews must be **complete markdown blocks** — never split across messages  
- Devlogs include **full transcripts**, including original prompts  
- **CHAT_LOG.md is now obsolete; devlog files are the authoritative transcript**
- Devlogs must include the *entire* chat back-and-forth (user and AI), with *no* code or file outputs—just the pure conversation, in a single markdown code block  
- No emoji or non-ASCII characters are allowed in code, logs, or documentation  

---

## GitHub Integration

All commit links use:  
`https://github.com/toddm-ClaybookAdvisors/layercake-method/commit/<hash>`

Prompt links use:  
`logs/PROMPTS.md#prompt-XXXX`

Devlogs are stored at:  
`logs/devlog/devlog-XXXX.md`

---

## Git Commit Expectations

- All commit messages must be *detailed and explicit*, clearly describing what was changed and why (not just summary bullet points)
- When producing a `git commit` command, do *not* include any commentary after the command itself

---

## Chat Move Policy

- **A chat move only generates an updated boot prompt and does not increment the Layer number.**
- All changes, process frustrations, and user-driven policy updates must be immediately reflected in the boot prompt and enforced in all subsequent layers.

## Current Status

- **Last layer:** 0025 — config, versioning, and rendering refactored to use LAYER  
- **Current layer:** 0025 — (chat move does *not* increment)  
- **Next layer:** Use `create layer` to begin new work  

---

## Carry Forward Policy

- **Any future change in devlog, commit, or prompt-handling style arising from user frustration or process correction must be immediately reflected in this boot prompt and enforced in all layers going forward.**
- All policy, conversation, or workflow corrections—especially regarding devlog formatting, authoritative record-keeping, and the requirement for the *full, unbroken chat transcript (minus code and files) in the devlog*—must be honored with absolute precision.
