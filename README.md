# Building a Game with an LLM — A Prompt-Driven Dev Diary

## Purpose

This project is a transparent, prompt-by-prompt experiment in building a fully functional 2D adventure game using only natural language instructions to an AI assistant (ChatGPT).

The human (me) does not write any of the game’s code directly. Instead, the AI acts as the software engineer — generating all implementation details based on prompts I provide.

---

## Methodology

Each step of game development is initiated by a plain-language prompt and executed by the LLM.

Each commit includes:
- The exact prompt that led to the change
- The generated code that resulted from it
- A reference to the commit in a running log file

This creates a clear, traceable evolution of the project from zero to a playable game.

---

## Prompt Tracking

Prompt and result pairs are tracked using Git commit history and a single file named `PROMPTS.md`.

- Each commit message includes the full prompt and a summary of the result.
- The prompt is also included as a comment at the top of any generated code files.
- `PROMPTS.md` serves as a human-readable index of the development process.

This avoids the need for managing dozens of small files while maintaining a full, navigable history.

## Project Structure

game/ ← Source code generated by the AI
README.md ← This file
PROMPTS.md ← Running log of all prompts and responses


---

## Iteration Format

- All prompt/result pairs are committed to Git.
- Prompt is included in both the commit message and at the top of each modified code file.
- `PROMPTS.md` logs the high-level evolution in readable format.

---

## Why This Matters

This project is not just about building a game. It demonstrates:
- How large language models can be used as hands-on development collaborators
- What makes a prompt effective
- How to trace software evolution transparently from human intent to working code

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- Git for version control

The first prompt will set up the Python environment for development.
