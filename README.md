You're now in **record mode**, and we'll begin logging the project history cleanly, starting with the first official prompt and result pair.

# 🧠 Building a Game with an LLM — A Prompt-Driven Dev Diary

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a transparent, prompt-by-prompt experiment in **building a fully functional 2D adventure game using only natural language instructions to an AI assistant (ChatGPT)**.

The human (me) will not write any of the game’s code directly. Instead, the AI will act as the software engineer — generating all implementation details based on prompts I provide.

---

## 📚 Methodology

Every game development step is created through a clear and versioned workflow:

1. **A natural language prompt** is written to describe the desired change or feature.
2. **ChatGPT generates runnable code** in response.
3. **That prompt and result are committed together** in Git as a discrete unit of progress.

Each iteration builds on the last, layering the game's complexity over time.

## 🗂 Project Structure

```

game/                  ← Source code generated by the AI
prompts/               ← Markdown files containing each prompt used
results/               ← (Optional) Raw text output or alternate renderings of results
README.md              ← This file
log.md                 ← (Optional) Chronological index of all iterations

```

- Each file in `prompts/` is named with a numeric ID and short description (e.g. `0003-player-movement.md`).
- Each commit includes a reference to the relevant prompt file.
- Generated code files include the original prompt as a comment at the top.

---

## 🔁 Iteration Format

Each prompt/result pair is treated as a unit of development:

- The prompt is saved in `prompts/000X-something.md`.
- The generated code appears in `game/` with the prompt included as a comment.
- The Git commit message includes:  
  `feat: <summary> (prompt 000X)`

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters

This project is not just about making a game — it’s about demonstrating how LLMs can serve as full-stack software collaborators. It explores:

- How far you can get using natural language alone
- What makes a good prompt
- How to structure an AI-human development pipeline

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed (see next prompt for setup)
- Git for version control

---

## 🛣️ First Step

The first prompt in this project will establish the development environment and Python setup instructions.
```

---

### ✅ Git Commit for This Iteration

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Add project purpose and structure (prompt 0001)"
```

Let me know if you'd like to save this to `prompts/0001-project-structure.md` or continue with the next prompt.
