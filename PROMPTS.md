## Prompt 0001: Define Project Purpose, Structure, and Prompt Tracking

**Instruction:**

Generate the README.md file explaining the purpose of this project and the way it will be structured. This project demonstrates how an LLM can be used to build a 2D game in layers through prompt-based iteration. Each commit will include the full prompt, the generated result, and a reference in a running log file. The chosen tracking method is a single PROMPTS.md file and Git commit messages as the primary source of truth.

**Result:**

→ See: README.md  
→ Commit: 0001 (Define project purpose, structure, and prompt tracking)
