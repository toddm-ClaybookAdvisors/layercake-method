## Prompt 0001: Define Project Purpose, Structure, and Prompt Tracking

**Instruction:**

Generate the README.md file explaining the purpose of this project and the way it will be structured. This project demonstrates how an LLM can be used to build a 2D game in layers through prompt-based iteration. Each commit will include the full prompt, the generated result, and a reference in a running log file. The chosen tracking method is a single PROMPTS.md file and Git commit messages as the primary source of truth.

**Result:**

→ See: README.md  
→ Commit: 0001 (Define project purpose, structure, and prompt tracking)

## Prompt 0002: Add Python Environment Setup Instructions for macOS

**Instruction:**

Create instructions for setting up a Python 3 virtual environment on macOS that I can include in a README file. Assume the user does not have Python installed.

**Result:**

→ See: README.md  
→ Commit: 0002 (Add Python environment setup instructions for macOS)

## Prompt 0002: Add Python Environment Setup Instructions for macOS - *NOTE* I had a sidebar with our friend because it kept breaking the instructions into steps that were part of the chat, not the contiguous code block I had asked for

**Instruction:**

Create instructions for setting up a Python 3 virtual environment on macOS that I can include in a README file. Assume the user does not have Python installed.

**Result:**

→ See: README.md  
→ Commit: 0002 (Add Python environment setup instructions for macOS)

## Prompt 0003: Add Basic ASCII Game Loop with WASD Movement

**Instruction:**

Create the simplest possible game loop in Python that runs in the terminal and redraws a small ASCII map on every iteration. The player should be represented by `@` and should be able to move up, down, left, and right using the WASD keys. Use only built-in libraries. Do not worry about real-time input or screen clearing yet — just focus on the loop and basic movement logic.

**Result:**

→ See: game/game.py
→ Commit: 0003 (Add basic ASCII game loop with WASD movement)

## Prompt 0004: Add .gitignore for Python and VS Code

**Instruction:**

Create a `.gitignore` file for a Python project that includes standard Python exclusions as well as common Visual Studio Code settings and folders.

**Result:**

→ See: .gitignore  
→ Commit: 0004 (Add .gitignore for Python and VS Code)
